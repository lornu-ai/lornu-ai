  # Note: Dependabot doesn't have native Bun support yet
  # Since Bun uses package.json as the source of truth (compatible with npm),
  # we keep npm ecosystem to monitor package.json updates
  # Developers should run `bun install` after merging dependabot PRs to update bun.lock

    # Bun uses package.json, so npm updates are compatible
    # After merging, run: bun install to update bun.lock
